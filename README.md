project IDEA exercise 1.2: Creating simple twitter app
Create a simple twitter app.
1 . Tweets will depend on this file. The tweets shown in page should change if this file is
also changed. (tip: use AJAX)
2. Use cookies and/or local storage so that new tweets created will remain in the
homepage. (tip: use JSON class in javascript)
3. There will be points dedicated on the User Interface of this web application. Use
Bootstrap or Semantic UI ​as the main css framework on designing this app. You can
add your own css file by creating a new one. (tip: To override some predefined attributes
of bootstrap or semantic ui css file, import the css of bootstrap or semantic ui first and
then import your own css file or use !important keyword)
4. This website should be responsive on the screen size of iPhone 5. Meaning, the layout of
the website can look “destroyed” on mobile phones with smaller screen size than the
iPhone 5 but the website should look great on mobile phones with same or bigger screen
size than the iPhone 5. (tip: Start developing your web application from mobile phones
first and then build your web application for desktop computer)
5. You can also use jQuery and other javascript libraries (even if they are not stated in this
exercise).
a. Your web application should work on Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, and Opera.
b. Best twitter app will have a special prize from the tutors. :)
BONUS: Use firebase on creating, retrieving, updating, and deleting tweets. The attributes
of a tweet should be the same as the ones used in a json file.
